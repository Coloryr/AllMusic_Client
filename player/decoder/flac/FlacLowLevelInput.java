    // such as for a non-seekable network input stream of unknown length.

    // (other than close()) or accessing fields thereafter should be forbidden.
    // The close() method must be idempotent and safe when called more than once.
    // If an implementation does not have native or time-sensitive resources, it is okay for the class user
    // to skip calling close() and simply let the object be garbage-collected. But out of good habit, it is
    // recommended to always close a FlacLowLevelInput stream so that the logic works correctly on all types.
